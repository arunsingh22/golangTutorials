# Observer Design Pattern
### Also known as: Event-Subscriber, Listener

## Defination:
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

1. Observer design pattern is used for pushing the data to all the subscribers when there is a internal state change in the observalbe object. This eliminates the POLL requests made by all the oberservables. **So now whenever there is state change a PUSH notification is sent to all the register oberservalbes and then the oberservalbes make a PULL request for the new change data.**
