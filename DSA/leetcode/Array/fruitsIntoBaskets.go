// You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

// You want to collect as much fruit as possible.
//  However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

// You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
// Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every
// tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must
// fit in one of your baskets.
// Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
// Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
